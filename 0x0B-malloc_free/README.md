# ALX: Understanding Memory Allocation.
## The Use of Malloc, Free.
### Managing Memory Leaks with Valgrind
#### Areas Covered
* What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation
* What is malloc and free and how to use them
* Why and when use malloc
* How to use valgrind to check for memory leak

#### Tasks Lists
* 0-create_array.c
    * Float Like a Butterfly, Sting Like a Bee:
        * Write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.
        * Prototype: char *create_array(unsigned int size, char c);
        * Returns NULL if size = 0
        * Returns a pointer to the array, or NULL if it fails
* 1-strdup.c
* 2-str_concat.c
* 3-alloc_grid.c
* 4-free_grid.c
* 100-argstostr.c
* 101-strtow.c
